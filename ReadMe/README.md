my project name: 
the sam willows band website is a website made to allow more individuals to more understanding about this particular local band, a rare jem in homeland singapore. 

Design process:
 With this website, I hope to promote the band's music and reach greater audience by providing links to their social media and music, as well as information about the band. They are the biggest band in Singapore but sadly, they are not gaining popularity in many more countries. This website would provide an interface for new aundience who are curious about them, and may have the potential to be their new source of audience.
 the adobe xd wireframe will show my design process.
